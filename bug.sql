The following SQL query attempts to use a subquery in the FROM clause, which is not supported by all SQL dialects.  It also has a potential syntax error in some database systems when using the `IN` operator with a subquery that returns multiple columns.

```sql
SELECT * FROM (
  SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1 WHERE condition1
) AS subquery WHERE column1 IN (SELECT column3, column4 FROM table2);
```
