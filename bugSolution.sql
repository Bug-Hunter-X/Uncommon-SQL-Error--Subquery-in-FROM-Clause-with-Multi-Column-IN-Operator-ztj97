Several solutions address the issues present in the original SQL query:

**Solution 1: Using JOINs**

This is generally the preferred method for efficiency and clarity:

```sql
SELECT t1.column1, t1.column2
FROM table1 t1
INNER JOIN table2 t2 ON t1.column1 = t2.column3 AND t1.column2 = t2.column4
WHERE condition1;
```

**Solution 2: Using EXISTS (for checking existence)**

If the goal is to check for the existence of a matching row in `table2`, the `EXISTS` operator is more efficient than `IN`:

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table1
WHERE condition1 AND EXISTS (
  SELECT 1
  FROM table2
  WHERE table1.column1 = table2.column3 AND table1.column2 = table2.column4
);
```

**Solution 3:  Using a Common Table Expression (CTE)**

For complex queries, a CTE can improve readability:

```sql
WITH Subquery AS (
  SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1 WHERE condition1
)
SELECT sq.column1, sq.column2
FROM Subquery sq
INNER JOIN table2 t2 ON sq.column1 = t2.column3 AND sq.column2 = t2.column4;
```

Choose the solution that best fits your specific SQL dialect and query requirements.  The `JOIN` approach is often the most efficient and widely compatible.
